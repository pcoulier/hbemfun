* two individual blocks in order to calculate the sum, difference,
* product, and quotient/remainder of two multi-block BigUnsigned
* numbers.
*
* As alluded to in the comment before class `BigUnsigned',
* these algorithms bear a remarkable similarity (in purpose, if
* not in implementation) to the way humans operate on big numbers.
* The built-in `+', `-', `*', `/' and `%' operators are analogous
* to elementary-school ``math facts'' and ``times tables''; the
* four routines below are analogous to ``long division'' and its
* relatives.  (Only a computer can ``memorize'' a times table with
* 18446744073709551616 entries!  (For 32-bit blocks.))
*
* The discovery of these four algorithms, called the ``classical
* algorithms'', marked the beginning of the study of computer science.
* See Section 4.3.1 of Knuth's ``The Art of Computer Programming''.

/*
 * On most calls to put-here operations, it's safe to read the inputs little by
 * little and write the outputs little by little.  However, if one of the
 * inputs is coming from the same variable into which the output is to be
 * stored (an "aliased" call), we risk overwriting the input before we read it.
 * In this case, we first compute the result into a temporary BigUnsigned
 * variable and then copy it into the requested output variable *this.
 * Each put-here operation uses the DTRT_ALIASED macro (Do The Right Thing on
 * aliased calls) to generate code for this check.
 *
 * I adopted this approach on 2007.02.13 (see Assignment Operators in
 * BigUnsigned.hh).  Before then, put-here operations rejected aliased calls
 * with an exception.  I think doing the right thing is better.
 *
 * Some of the put-here operations can probably handle aliased calls safely
 * without the extra copy because (for example) they process blocks strictly
 * right-to-left.  At some point I might determine which ones don't need the
 * copy, but my reasoning would need to be verified very carefully.  For now
 * I'll leave in the copy.

* About the multiplication and division algorithms:
*
* I searched unsucessfully for fast built-in operations like the `b_0'
* and `c_0' Knuth describes in Section 4.3.1 of ``The Art of Computer
* Programming'' (replace `place' by `Blk'):
*
*    ``b_0[:] multiplication of a one-place integer by another one-place
*      integer, giving a two-place answer;
*
*    ``c_0[:] division of a two-place integer by a one-place integer,
*      provided that the quotient is a one-place integer, and yielding
*      also a one-place remainder.''
*
* I also missed his note that ``[b]y adjusting the word size, if
* necessary, nearly all computers will have these three operations
* available'', so I gave up on trying to use algorithms similar to his.
* A future version of the library might include such algorithms; I
* would welcome contributions from others for this.
*
* I eventually decided to use bit-shifting algorithms.  To multiply `a'
* and `b', we zero out the result.  Then, for each `1' bit in `a', we
* shift `b' left the appropriate amount and add it to the result.
* Similarly, to divide `a' by `b', we shift `b' left varying amounts,
* repeatedly trying to subtract it from `a'.  When we succeed, we note
* the fact by setting a bit in the quotient.  While these algorithms
* have the same O(n^2) time complexity as Knuth's, the ``constant factor''
* is likely to be larger.
*
* Because I used these algorithms, which require single-block addition
* and subtraction rather than single-block multiplication and division,
* the innermost loops of all four routines are very similar.  Study one
* of them and all will become clear.

/*
* The out-of-bounds accesses story:
*
* On 2005.01.06 or 2005.01.07 (depending on your time zone),
* Milan Tomic reported out-of-bounds memory accesses in
* the Big Integer Library.  To investigate the problem, I
* added code to bounds-check every access to the `blk' array
* of a `NumberlikeArray'.
*
* This gave me warnings that fell into two categories of false
* positives.  The bounds checker was based on length, not
* capacity, and in two places I had accessed memory that I knew
* was inside the capacity but that wasn't inside the length:
*
* (1) The extra zero block at the left of `*this'.  Earlier
* versions said `allocateAndCopy(len + 1); blk[len] = 0;'
* but did not increment `len'.
*
* (2) The entire digit array in the conversion constructor
* ``BigUnsignedInABase(BigUnsigned)''.  It was allocated with
* a conservatively high capacity, but the length wasn't set
* until the end of the constructor.
*
* To simplify matters, I changed both sections of code so that
* all accesses occurred within the length.  The messages went
* away, and I told Milan that I couldn't reproduce the problem,
* sending a development snapshot of the bounds-checked code.
*
* Then, on 2005.01.09-10, he told me his debugger still found
* problems, specifically at the line `delete [] work2'.
* It was `work2', not `blk', that was causing the problems;
* this possibility had not occurred to me at all.  In fact,
* the problem was that `work2' needed an extra block just
* like `*this'.  Go ahead and laugh at me for finding (1)
* without seeing what was actually causing the trouble.  :-)
*
* The 2005.01.11 version fixes this problem.  I hope this is
* the last of my memory-related bloopers.  So this is what
* starts happening to your C++ code if you use Java too much!
